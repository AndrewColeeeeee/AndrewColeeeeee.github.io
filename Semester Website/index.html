<h2>Interests</h2>
 <p>Football</p>
 <p><h3>Football is my favorite sport I may not play it but it is my favorite. I find the sport action packed and exhilarating, I also am a die hard Green bay fan since birth. I do watch games on my free time and enjoy watching it with my dad. I am hoping that the Packers make it to the super bowl all we need to do is beat the falcons. It still will be a challenge too</h3></p>
 <p>Music</p>
<p><h3>I LOVE music and listen to music all the time I listen to everything but my favorite genre is hip hop. And my favorite artist has to be J Cole, he is makes amazing music and he is real. What I mean by this is that he is writing his own music and within every song there is a meaning, he is intelegent and passionate. But J cole is not the only artist I listen to I also listen to artist such as Tupac Shakur, Kendrick Lamar, Drake, and so on. Hip hop i listen to most but in my early years I listened to a lot of rock before being introduced to rap.</h3>
